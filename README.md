## D.K'S TALE  

**Captain D.K**, a former explorer, was part of a devastating shipwreck while sailing for India to gather exotic spices for his majesty and **turned unconscious**. Upon regaining his consciousness, he found himself ashore a remote island in which **living skeletons are widespread.** These skeletons can perform any regular physical tasks just like humans; however, unlike us, **they do not possess any free will** and act according to their given command, just like domesticated animals, lacking emotion and critical thought because of the absence of their heart and mind. Upon witnessing this amazing discovery, he **ordered the skeletons to gather resources and build a ship for him**, which was followed and executed at once. His goal? Going back to his mainland with the treasure that his majesty originally granted him in addition to these newly accustomed “slaves”. Beware! Ill-intentioned pirates are lurking around to amass wealth wherever they may find it. *“The Treasure Reflects its Guardian”*; **can you prove yourself worthy of guarding the royal treasure?**
